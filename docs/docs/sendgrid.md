To setup SENDGRID you would need to create a account [here](https://www.sendgrid.com) if you need help getting a API key its not that hard.  Here's a guide on it. [https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/) .  To stop email from going to spam you may want to setup the domain so they know you own the domain your sending from.
